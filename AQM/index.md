Mendix Application Quality Monitor (AQM) 

Mendix Application Quality Monitor (AQM) is a cloud service developed by Mendix and the Software Improvement Group (SIG). 
Mendix AQM performs a static analysis of Mendix application models according the ISO 25010 standard for maintainability. 
Dashboards then provide instant insight into the quality of the application models as their built, 
including quality ratings based on benchmarks of thousands of projects. 

By monitoring quality proactively and on a daily basis, customers are able to improve maintainability and reduce lifecycle costs.

The Mendix Application Quality Monitor (AQM) quality model is based on the **SIG/TÜViT Evaluation Criteria**. These criteria provide standardized evaluation and certification of the technical quality of the source code of software products. The purpose of such evaluation and certification is to provide an instrument to developers for guiding improvement of the products they create and enhance.

The general notion of software quality embraces a variety of quality aspects, of which a taxonomy is available in the ISO/IEC 25010 international standard on software product quality. The scope of the SIG/TÜViT **Evaluation Criteria** is limited to the internal quality characteristic of maintainability and its sub-characteristics of **analyzability, modifiability, testability, modularity and reusability**. The evaluation concerns the source code of a software product, not the behavior of the product in a test or production environment.
